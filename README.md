# ENG720 Honours Thesis - Python Simulation

This repository contains a selection of power systems models with load frequency controllers. Works contained herein are models that are being used to research the Load Frequency Control problem.

## Python Models

Briefly this repository is broken into a number of key sections:

1. Custom Python class for modelling power systems
2. Single area power systems
3. Two area power systems

Blog posts explaining the development of single area and two area power system models can be found [here](https://blank.org/) and [here](https://blank.org/).

Many of the models that are implemented here, have been rapidly iterated or tested in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. A link to the MATLAB/Simulink models can be found in the following repository [here](https://github.com/skreynolds/ENG720_matlab_models/blob/master/README.md).

## Thesis report

The thesis work aims to present a case for automatic generation control of a two area power system using a deep reinforcement learning agent. The developed model is compared against classical control techniques. A link to the thesis report repository can be found [here](https://github.com/skreynolds/ENG720_honours_thesis).
